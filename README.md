Avoid catching all exceptions if you can't do anything meaningful with them. It is common practice to use a catch block (Exception e) to catch all exceptions. However, if all you do is log the exception and throw it again, this can hide errors and make it more difficult to track them.

Use custom exceptions to expose problems specific to your code. These can be used to wrap lower-level exceptions and provide additional information about the context in which an error occurred.

Document the exceptions your methods throw. This helps users understand what types of errors can occur and how they should handle them.

Don't catch exceptions you can't handle. If you can't fix the problem or provide useful feedback to the user, it's probably better to let the exception propagate.

If you handle an exception and throw it again, consider using throw; instead of throw e;. The latter will reset the call stack, which can make tracking the problem more difficult.
